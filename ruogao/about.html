<p>The brand message is "inspiration trickyness". Moreover, "Yokoku of Kokuyo" is also used in CM etc.</p>

<p>In March 2015, KOKUYO rejuvenated its management system and in October, KOKUYO Co. Ltd merged with two key operating companies to go beyond the framework of our existing business and to strive to create value that our clients truly desire.</p>

<p>To this end, we have adopted a new 3-year basic management policy that is "Self-reform focusing on value creation - Value Transformation 2018". There will be an "operating model reform" that realizes customer-oriented value creation and the "development of sustainable profitability" to enable medium to long term sustainable growth. The goals of the current medium term management plan are: (1) "The acquisition of funds for growth": to achieve an operating profit from domestic businesses of at least ¥15 billion, (2)"The implementation of high efficiency management": to achieve an operating margin of at least 5%, (3) "Self-sustainability overseas": to achieve profit stability in our overseas businesses. In fiscal year 2018, we aim to achieve at least ¥310 billion sales, gross margin of at least 35%, operating margin of at least 5% and an operating margin of at least ¥15.5 billion.</p>

<p>The KOKUYO Group philosophy is to enrich the world through our products. We are constantly looking for ways to make people more creative through careful observation of their lives and work.Stationery is an important tool for intellectual activities, and furniture is an essential factor in composing a space for such activities. By developing products that capture user needs and by offering suggestions on the use of such products, our goal is to develop a more creative society.</p>
