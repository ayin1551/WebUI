<h1 align="center">History of KOKUYO Company</h1>
<h3>	The years of active investment ---- 1979 - 1988</h3><p>Japan went through two oil crises in the 70s, and experienced economic turmoil with its first post-war period of negative growth, but KOKUYO minimized the danger by taking action such as implementing bold organizational changes. As a result, the company grew to the point where it achieved the long-awaited sales figure of ¥100 billion in 1979. The same year, the new Tōkyō office – which employees had been looking forward to – was completed as a base for the Kantō region, and two years later, in the same location, the company expanded its business, and the largest show room in the industry was completed. One of the topics of those years was that of KOKUYO aggressively working on product development in order to expand its client base in the furniture business. Equipment for shop furniture and fixtures</p>

<h3>	The rapid growth years ---- 1989 - 1997</h3><p>The movement of the "advanced information society", which had been gathering momentum since the second half of the 80s, also reached the office industry in areas such as intelligent buildings. Together with the promotion of new offices, it led to a new office boom, and KOKUYO became a ¥300 billion business in 1991, only three years after having achieved a sales figure of ¥200 billion. At that moment, KOKUYO set out to create a new image for itself, as an "office space creative company", adding "information" to its two conventional pillars: paper products and furniture.</p>

<h3>	The reform years ---- 1998 - 2005</h3><p>Due to the structural recession which followed the bursting of Japan's so-called bubble and continued from the late 90s onwards, there was a widespread cooling off of market demand. In response to this, KOKUYO took various countermeasures, such as reforming and reorganizing its distribution system, and entering the fast-growing Chinese market. One of these countermeasures was the development of the network distribution business, the first attempt being the "Benri Net", an office supplies order system which operation started in 1997. The following year, KOKUYO launched its "C-business (@office)" catalogue mail order business aimed at distribution support, followed in 2001 by a general mail order business for office supplies "Kaunet" targeting small and home offices, the so-called Sohos.</p>

<h3>	New horizons and growth in Asia ---- 2006 - 2015</h3><p>KOKUYO has been planning a company-wide structural reform since 2002. In 2004, the company made a move towards spinning off some of its businesses and was restructured as a holding company. Then in 2005 － the year that marked the company's 100th anniversary － all employees joined forces to reconfirm the company's founding spirit, and KOKUYO had a fresh start as the KOKUYO Group. This was also a good occasion to redesign the company logo, which had become very familiar since its first appearance in 1981. The global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers had a major impact on the Japanese market too. KOKUYO is now taking a step back, to its origins, engaging in large-scale reform as a business that aims to be of service in a changing market. For example, in a mature market such as the stationery business, KOKUYO aims to create products that help to add value for those clients who use them.</p>
